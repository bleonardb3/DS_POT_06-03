# IBM Proof of Technology - End-to-End Data Science using Watson Studio

## Description:
Watson Studio provides you with the environment and tools to solve your business problems by collaboratively working with data. You can choose the tools you need to analyze and visualize data, to cleanse and shape data, to ingest streaming data, or to create, train, and deploy machine learning/deep learning models. Watson Studio contains both open source and IBM value-add capabilities to help infuse AI into business to drive innovation. 

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - This lab will set up the Watson Studio environment for subsequent labs and introduce you to the Project and Community features of Watson Studio

1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - In this lab, you will use the Watson SPSS Modeler capability to explore, prepare, and model the trafficking data. The SPSS Modeler is a drag and drop capability to build machine learning pipelines.

1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - In this lab, you will use SparkML in Watson Studio to run simulated travel data through a machine learning algorithm, automatically tune the algorithm, and load the data into a DB2 Warehouse database.

1. [Lab-4](Lab-4) -This lab will use the MNIST computer vision data set to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits. The Watson Studio neural network flow editor, Watson Studio experiment builder and the Watson Machine Learning component will be used to build, train, save, deploy, and test the model.
